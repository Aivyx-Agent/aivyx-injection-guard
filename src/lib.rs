//! Heuristic detection of likely prompt-injection markers in content that
//! enters an agent's context from outside the user's own direct input —
//! tool output, fetched pages, file contents, or any other untrusted
//! external content a consumer chooses to scan.
//!
//! This is a tripwire, not a classifier: a static phrase list will both
//! miss real injection attempts phrased differently and flag benign text
//! that happens to mention one of these phrases (including, ironically,
//! this crate's own docs/tests about this feature). That's an accepted
//! cost — the intended response to a match is "surface it for a human (or
//! an unattended-run policy) to judge," not a silent classifier verdict.
//!
//! Extracted from `aivyx-coder`'s own `aivyx-sandbox` crate (originally
//! `injection_scan.rs`) so `aivyx` (the flagship Personal Assistant) can
//! share the same primitive rather than reimplementing it — same
//! rationale as `aivyx-confine`/`aivyx-checkpoint`/`aivyx-kvcache`.
